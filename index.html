        A log of the thought processes I have been through and solutions I have
        come to in trying to solve the javascript problems provided by

        <p>
          While creating factorial algorithm, biggest roadblock was in not
          recognising that the formula was trying to multiply by 0 so the result
          kept coming back as NaN. The solution was to take the number that was
          to be factorised, create an array from 1 to that number, and then
          create a <span class="code-func">for</span> loop:
        </p>
        <br />
        <pre><code class='language-javascript'>
                let sum = 0;
                for (let i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
                        sum = sum * arr[i];
                    }
        </code></pre>
        <br />
        <p>
          My first attempt to run this loop was unsuccessful and kept returning
          0. That's because I didn't acknowledge the fact that starting the loop
          at 0 means that the sum will never be larger than 0 because every time
          we are multiplying by 0. So I fixed the problem by changing the
          default value of
          <span class="code-var">sum</span> to 1, and the default value of
          <span class="code-var">i</span> in the
          <span class="code-func">for</span> loop that created the initial array
          to 1.

          The first part of the problem was to convert the string into an array
          of words. For this I used the split() method, giving &quot; &quot; as
          the splitting parameter. I then had to find a way to get the lengths
          of each string in this array. I thought that the length property only
          worked on arrays, so spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to
          convert the strings in the array to separate characters in a sub-array
          which was super messy and confusing. It turns out you <em>can</em> use
          the length property to just get the length of a string.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second part of the challenge is to figure out a way to compare the
          numbers in the newly created strLenArr to find the largest one. At
          first I thought this would be simple, but am struggling to come up
          with a solution on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turns out it <em>was</em> simple! It's just a matter of creating an
          <span class="code-func">if</span> statement in a <span class='code-func'>for</span> loop. The
          <span class="code-func">for</span> loop runs through each element in
          the array and the <span class="code-func">if</span> statement checks
          if that element is higher than the number stored in the variable
          <span class="code-var">highest</span>.
          <span class="code-var">highest</span> is set to 0 by default so the
          first number encountered in the
          <span class="code-func">for</span> loop becomes the new value for
          <span class="code-var">highest</span>. Each time the <span class='code-func'>for</span> loop
          iterates, the <span class="code-func">if</span> statement checks the
          value of the current element in the array against
          <span class="code-var">highest</span>. If it's higher, it will become
          the new value for <span class="code-var">highest</span>.

        Bearing some resemblance to the previous problem where the longest
        string had to be found, this problem is somewhat more complex since the
        array is 2-dimensional, which means that I will probably have to use a
        nested <span class="code-func">for</span> loop to access the sub-arrays.

        I created <span class="code-var">newArr</span> to store the highest
        number in each sub-array. I created the nested <span class='code-func'>for</span> loop, but am not sure
        what to do with it. currently it just returns every number in every
        sub-array in a row. I need there to be a break between looping through
        sub-arrays so that my if statement is not looking for the highest number
        across all sub-arrays. I will go and look at some examples of nested
        <span class="code-func">for</span> loops to see if anything looks
        useful. <br /><br />
        I guess I'm looking for a way to break out of the inner loop when the
        highest number in that sub-array is found. So perhaps putting an
        <span class="code-func">if</span> statement there will accomplish this.
        <br /><br />
        I feel like I'm getting closer. I realised that to exit the inner loop
        there just needs to be something returned from an
        <span class="code-func">if</span> statement. I've added an
        <span class="code-func">else if</span> condition to try and stop the
        loop from continuing to push to <span class="code-var">num</span> if it
        passes.... okay .... that's dumb. I don't think that part makes sense
        actually. <br /><br />
        The inner <span class='code-func'>for</span> loop is fine, I just need to somehow push
        <span class="code-var">num</span> to
        <span class="code-var">newArr</span> when the inner (j) loop finishes
        executing. <br /><br />
        What if I add another <span class="code-func">if</span> statement to the
        inner loop... No... an OR condition in the of statement that says 'if
        the inner loop has reached the length of the array, push
        <span class="code-var">num</span> to the new array...'<br /><br />
        Not quite right but along the right lines...
        <br /><br />
        Actually yes, two <span class="code-func">if</span> statements in the
        inner loop. The first checks if the number in the sub-array is larger
        than num, then updates <span class="code-var">num</span> with that
        number. The second if statement checks if the loop has reached the end
        of the sub-array. But I can't think of a way to track the progress of
        the loop unless I add a<span class="code-var">count</span> er to the
        first <span class="code-func">if</span> statement:
        <span class="code-var">count++</span>. This will iterate a variable in
        the outer loop that will reset each time the inner loop finishes
        executing. So the second <span class="code-func">if</span> statement
        will compare the number stored in <span class="code-var">count</span> to
        the length of the array. If they are the same, then push
        <span class="code-var">num</span> to
        <span class="code-var">newArr</span> <br /><br />

        So close now! This returns the correct array for most inputs, but if the
        inputs are negative numbers it fails because the
        <span class="code-func">if</span> statement is comparing to 0.
        <br /><br />
        Ideally, instead of comparing the element in the sub-array at [i][j] to
        a standalone variable outside the loop, I would compare it to the last
        number that has just been passed so that the reference for size is not
        fixed at 0 to begin with. But this seems quite beyond me at this point
        in time and I think its time to move on so I will just set
        <span class="code-var">num</span> to a very low negative number. That
        should take care of the problem, but is a cop-out for sure. I hope to
        return to this problem one day better-equipped to truly solve it.

        Well this looks like a toughie. I need to take a string variable and a
        target variable and see if target appears at the end of the string. I am
        told that this can be solved with the
        <span class="code-func">endsWith()</span>
        method introduced in ES2015, but that I shouldn't use it. I must instead
        use substring methods to solve this puzzle.
        <br /><br />
        I want to try and turn both the string and target variables into arrays,
        but something tells me that would be quite a rabbit hole to go down. I
        will instead look at working with only strings and see how far I get.
        <br /><br />
        After looking here for a list of string methods, I bumped into an old
        friend. <span class="code-func">indexOf()</span> can be used to find the
        start and end position of <span class="code-var">target</span> in the
        string. Could I just ask for the index of
        <span class="code-var">target</span>, and then if it is not found,
        return <span class="code-var">false</span>? Could it be that easy? Let's
        see. <br /><br />
        <pre><code class='language-javascript'>
          function confirmEnding(str, target) {
            if(str.indexOf(target)==true){
              str=true;
            }else{
            return false};
          
             str=false;
          }
          
          confirmEnding('Bastian', 'n');

        <br /><br />
        Kind of embarrassing code. Just thought I'd see… so I guess
        <span class="code-func">str.indexOf(target)</span> will not directly
        give true or false if there is a match. So let's try a longer way.
        <br /><br />
        <pre><code class='language-javascript'>
          function confirmEnding(str, target) {
            const slicer = str.slice(str.indexOf(target));
            if(slicer==target){
              return true;
            }else{
              return false;
            }
          }
          
          confirmEnding('Bastian', 'n');

        This was my next idea, and I'm really surprised that it worked. The idea
        that I sort of fumbled my way towards is that
        <span class="code-var">slicer</span> would attempt to isolate the target
        part of <span class="code-var">str</span>, and if it failed to do so….
        <br />wait, what?? Why does this code even work. According to the
        FreeCodeCamp checker I have passed all but one of the tests with this
        code….. <br /><br />
        <img
          src="https://i811.photobucket.com/albums/zz39/EraseBegin/ffc-checks.png"

          height="600"
        />
        <br /><br />
        This function is ridiculous... how is it passing all of these tests? It
        isn't even checking if the target is appearing on the end of the string.
        So why would ('Open sesame','pen') return false while ('Bastian', 'n')
        returns true.... and then ('Congratulation', 'on') returns false.....
        With the 3rd example I guess the difference is that the target substring
        appears twice. But if I don't understand how this function is working
        now, I can't go about improving it.
        <br /><br />
        I went away and looked at that list of string methods again. Just below
        <span class="code-func">indexOf</span> I found
        <span class="code-func">lastIndexOf</span>. I still don't quite
        understand how this formula works, but I thought surely if I just
        replace <span class="code-func">indexOf</span> with
        <span class="code-func">lastIndexOf</span> it would fix the problem I
        was having with finding duplicate substrings. Sure enough that did the
        trick. Still not quite sure why this works, but it does! On to the next
        challenge!

        The challenge: take a string and a number and repeat the string that
        number of times. An empty string must be returned if the number is less
        than 0. I really can't see this being much of a problem. First I'll want
        to check it the number is 0 or more, so I'll open with an
        <span class="code-var">if</span>
        statement. If that condition is met then perhaps I can use a
        <span class="code-var">for</span> loop along with the
        <span class="code-func">concat()</span> method to create the new string.
        The <span class="code-var">else</span>
        statement will create an empty string. Let's see how that pans out.

        So this is what I tried, but I am stumped. I can see that there is a
        problem with the logic in the
        <span class="code-var">for</span> loop, but can't put my finger on it.
        One problem is that <span class="code-var">str</span> is resetting every
        time the loop is run. But I don't think I could make the loop iterate
        the string variable since I'm not sure logical operators can be used on
        strings. I think I'm just going to try going the array route instead of
        concatenation. So the <span class='code-func'>for</span> loop will push the string to an array
        <span class="code-var">num</span> times. I can then hopefully convert
        the array back to a string using the
        <span class="code-func">toString()</span> method. <br /><br />
        Swapped out the guts, but it's not working... don't think it's something
        as simple as a syntax error.

        Okay weird. So I can't use <span class="code-var">i==num</span> as the
        condition for ending the loop. Not too sure why. Anyway, changed it to
        <span class="code-var">i&lt;num</span> and everything seems to be
        working. It's still not passing the tests however since the output is
        comma separated. Had a quick search and it seems I can use the
        <span class="code-func">join()</span> method to create a string without
        any separators. <br /><br />
        Bingo! That's it! There's probably a better way to solve this, but this
        will do for now.

          The task is to take a string and a number as inputs and return a
          string that is truncated to the index of that number. Then the final
          result should append an ellipse… It looked super simple at first and,
          as I suspected, it is.

          This passes almost all the tests, but the folks at FCC have thrown in
          a little curve ball:
        </p>
        <p>
          <img
            src="https://i811.photobucket.com/albums/zz39/EraseBegin/fcc-2.png"

          />
        </p>
        <p>
          After looking at this a while, I think it’s actually a massive
          curve-ball. How on earth…?<br />
          I guess <span class='code-func'>slice()</span> can’t
          take such a complex argument, but I don’t know how to add a step that
          simplifies the argument. I tried simply assigning num to a new
          variable, but that didn’t do it. The new variable would just contain
          the same level of complexity. So how do I ‘resolve’ this argument
          before I pass it to <span
          class='code-func'>slice()</span>?
        </p>
        <p>
          I guess I’ll try logging the outputs to try and see what’s going on.
          The console output is exactly what the checks are looking for…
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh! I misread the specification. It is not all outputs that should
          have an ellipse appended. For outputs that have the same length as the
          inputted string there should be no ellipse. This should be easy to
          fix.<br />
          Hmmm, added an if/else statement, but the output is still incorrect.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
          function truncateString(str, num) {
            let truncated = str.slice(0, num); 
            if(truncated==str.length){
              console.log(truncated) 
              return truncated;
            }else{
              console.log(truncated + '...') 
                return truncated + '...';
            }

        <p>
          Okay so a minor alteration. I had to get truncated out of the if
          statement. I should be comparing str to num directly, not comparing
          the sliced entity. And, given the code tests, I should be looking for
          lengths equal to or greater than <span class='code-var'>str.length</span>, not just equal to.

        <header id='find_element_in_array' class='main-section'>Find an Element in an Array</header>

        Here is the premise this time: the function takes 2 arguments. The first is an array, and the second is a function. My function must use the function in the second argument as a truth test for each element in the array. The function will return the first element in the array that passes the test. If none return true, then the function returns undefined. This is the template provided:
        
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        
        function findElement(arr, func) {
          let num = 0;
          return num;
        }
        
        findElement([1, 2, 3, 4], num => num % 2 === 0);
        
        </pre></code>
        
        I plan to make a <span class='code-func'>for</span> loop of course to move through the array. Within the <span class='code-func'>for</span> loop I could create an if statement that applies the test to each element in the array. Let's give it a go!
        <br><br>
        <b>1 hour later</b>
        <br><br>
        Uhhh...... stumped pretty early on here. 
        
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        
        function findElement(arr, func) {
          for(i=0; i&lt;arr.length; i++){
            console.log(func(arr[i]))
          }
          let num = 0;
          return num;
        }
        
        findElement([1, 2, 3, 4], num => num % 2 === 0);
        
        </pre></code>
        Tried logging the output of the function as it is passed each number in the array, but didn't get any output. One of the biggest challenges here is dealing with a function as an argument. I'm not sure how to handle it. This one has me truly stumped. Not sure what to search, not sure what to change, not sure what to log. I will leave some time to digest this and come back to it later. 
        <br><br>
        I give up, I'm going to peek at the clues. First clue: use a <span class='code-func'>for</span> loop to cycle through the array. Okay, done. Second clue: "<span class='code-var'>num</span> is passed to the function. We will need to set it to the elements we want to check with the function."
        <br><br>
        Okay I missed that. The importance of <span class='code-var'>num</span>. It was standing out there, but I didn't see it as relevant. So <span class='code-var'>num</span> needs to go inside the <span class='code-func'>for</span> loop I guess. What else? Wait, wait no....... I just tried something else! Haha, it was a syntax error. I didn't define the variable <span class='code-var'>i</span>. If I just add <span class='code-var'>let</span> to the if conditions, the output works! 
        
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        function findElement(arr, func) {
          for(let i=0; i&lt;arr.length; i++){
            let test = func(arr[i]);  
            if(test==true){
              return arr[i];
            } else {
              return null;
            }
          } 
          let num = 0;
          return num;
        }
        
        findElement([1, 2, 3, 4], num => num % 2 === 0);
        </pre></code>
        
        So now that I am getting a true or false output for each element in the array, all that's left to do is check if the first true condition is met. If so, return that element, else if the <span class='code-func'>for</span> loop reaches the length of the array, return null.
        <br><br>
        But I've come to the same problem as with a previous exercise: I don't know how to check if the <span class='code-func'>for</span> loop is at the end of the array. I faced this problem when I had to find the largest number in an array, but it seems that I <em>can</em> actually use <span class='code-var'>arr[i].length</span> to check if the loop has finished. I just thought that this would perhaps be testing the length of a single element in an array. Anyway, let's give it a go.
        
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
        function findElement(arr, func) {
          for(let i=0; i&lt;arr.length; i++){
            let test = func(arr[i]);  
            if(test==true){
              return arr[i];
            } else if (arr[i]==arr.length){
              return null;
            }
          } 
          let num = 0;
        }
        
        findElement([1, 3, 5, 9], num => num % 2 === 0);

        <header class='main-section' id='check_boolean_literals'>Checking for Boolean Literals</header>
        So the premise is simple: "Check if a value is classified as a boolean primitive. Return true or false."
        Well, a boolean is true or false... so write an if statement that checks if the input is true or false, and return true if it is. else, return false.
        
        <br><br><pre><code class="language-javascript">
        function booWho(bool) {
          if(bool == true || bool == false){
            return true;
          } else {
            return false;
          }
          return bool;
        }
        
        booWho(null);
        </code></pre><br><br>
        
        This passed most of the tests, but I forgot that there are other values that register as a boolean true or false. The function should recognise 1 and 0 as non-boolean since we are looking for boolean literals. I can't think of any other instances where an input would be recognised as boolean apart from this, so I will just account for 1 and 0 in my if statement.
        <br><br>
        Had to play around with this for a while because it was difficult to get the syntax right for the if statetent. I'm sure there must be a more succinct waheto write this, but anyway here is the new  if condition: 
        
        <br><br><pre><code class="language-javascript">
        if((bool == true || bool == false) && (bool !== 1) && (bool != 0))
        </code></pre><br><br>
        
        I was confident that that would be it, but now I am faced with the strange issue, that false is returning false. I have tried playing around with the if condition to correct this, but I can't figure it out. The best thing I can think of is to create a nested if statement where the outer statement first checks that bool is not 1 or 0, and then checks if it is a boolean value.
        
        <br><br><pre><code class="language-javascript">
        
        function booWho(bool) {
          if(bool !== 1 && bool !== 0){
            if(bool == false || bool == true){
              return true;
            }
          } else {
          return false;
          }
        }
        
        console.log(booWho(false));

        </code></pre><br><br>
        When I sat down to begin this problem, I thought it was the easiest one so far, but I guess booleans can get messy. I tried it this way, but it passes even fewer tests than before since it's now rejecting arrays that contain a 1. I know I've read about this before, but I can't remember where. I'm off to peruse the web...
        <br><br>
        According to <a href='https://www.w3schools.com/JS/js_booleans.asp'>w3schools</a>, in javascript "everything with a value is true" and "everything without a value is false." That seems important... but how to use that information? How do I get the function to distinguish between the boolean literal truth and all the other kinds of truth? 
        <br><br>
        Maybe I could use the stricter equivalence of === to verify the value of bool...
        <br><br>
        YEP! Bingo bango! Job's a good 'un.

        <header class='main-section' id='title_case_sentence'>Title Case a Sentence</header>
        Task: take a string of any combination of upper and lower case letters and change the first letter of each word to upper-case.
    <br><br>
Again, my first thought is to smash the string into a two-dimensional array and start trying to manipulate it through for loops, but there must surely be a simpler way using string methods. I there was one called toUpperCase(). So maybe I can split() the string at the spaces... that would make an array though. It's probably the case that dealing with arrays is inevitable here. Once I have an array I suppose I can use the indexOf() method to look for the first letter in each string in the array and then change it toUpperCase(). Let's see how that pans out.
<br><br>
Okay, so I can't use indexOf(). I forgot that it does the opposite of what I need. It returns the index of a  given string, not the string at a given index. But I've had a search and it seems there is a method called charAt() which does what I need. 

<br><br><pre><code class="language-javascript">
function titleCase(str) {
  let arr = str.split(' ');
  for(let i = 0; i>arr.length; i++){
    arr[i].charAt(0).toUpperCase()
  }
  str = arr.join(' ');
}

titleCase("I'm a little tea pot");
</pre></code><br><br>

Okay so some parts of this are working, but at least one thing isn't. If I feed the line arr[0].charAt(0).toUpperCase() to the console, it returns what I expected it to. Perhaps the problem is that this doesn't actually alter the strings in the array. Can I use push()? Seems unlikely, but I'll try. 
<br><br>
push() doesn't seem to be doing anything at all no matter what I try to push from within the for loop. Weird.
<br><br>
Played around with a bunch of stuff and am still scratching my head! So what do I _know_ is working?
Well split() is definitely creating a comma separated array, and join is definitely putting the string back together again correctly. So the problem is with the for loop. But syntactically it seems fine! I also don't understand why it's not possible to put a console.log() within the for loop AND whatever I put in the for loops seems to have no impact whatsoever on the array.
<br><br>
On the MDN pages it gives an example of a for loop and then uses console.log() to display the value of i as the loop iterates! So whaaaaat's going on? A simple syntax error? 
<br><br>
Okay, I have a clue. The for loop does everything it is supposed to and all logs are correct if I just change the exit condition to a fixed number. So there's a problem with using arr.length as the exit condition for the loop, but why? I've used array.length in several exercises before and have not experienced this problem. 
<br><br>
I swapped arr.length for str.length and that seems to have fixed the function, but still does not explain why I was having this problem. Anyway, onwards!
<br><br>
If I do this within the loop:

<br><br><pre><code class="language-javascript"></code>
console.log(arr[i].charAt(0).toUpperCase())
</pre></code><br><br>

It returns the first letter of each string in the array in upper case. Cool, but not what I need. I found another string method called setCharAt(), but this doesn't accept toUpperCase() as a parameter. I can imagine that there are many ways to solve this, but the one that occurs to me now is to use the above method to create a new array of capital letters and then create a new for loop that will use the setCharAt() method to change the set the first letter of each string.
<br><br>
Ooo0okay... according to the debug console setCharAt() is not a valid method. I think I was looking at Java, not Javascript. But there is a method called substr() which I could possibly use.
<br><br>
I was starting to think of all these crazy possibilities, my mind was going wild trying to figure this out. The more I thought about it, the more complex my thoughts became until I was convinced that this problem was totally beyond my grasp-- that it was overwhelmingly deep. But then I did this:

<br><br><pre><code class="language-javascript">

function titleCase(str) {
  let lstr = str.toLowerCase();
  let arr = lstr.split(' ');
  let capArr = [];
  let restArr = [];
  let newArr = [];
  for(let i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
     		capArr.push(arr[i].substr(0,1).toUpperCase());
     		restArr.push(arr[i].substr(1,arr[i].length))
     		newArr[i] = capArr[i]+restArr[i];
	}
	return newArr.join(' ')
}

titleCase("I'm a little tea pot");
</pre></code><br><br>
I wish I had written out the steps to that final solution, but I got into a flow. I'm not really sure how it came about. Anyway...

<header class='main-section' id='check_falsy_values'>Checking for Falsy Values</header>
<article>
<p>I have to check each element in an array for a falsy value. According to a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35642809/understanding-javascript-truthy-and-falsy">stackoverflow</a> post “all values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy.”</p>
<p>Values defined as falsy are Nan, undefined, 0, null, an empty string (’ ’), and of course, false. I think I can just use a for loop and a non-strict equivalence operator (==) to check if the value returns false. I’m sure there will be more to it, but on this occassion, and in future, I will try to avoid to avoid using for loops. A friend of mine says that they are problematic and outdated so I should be using array methods like map(), filter() and reduce().</p>
<p>In this case I think filter will be the best choice since I am wanting to ‘filter’ out values of a certain kind.</p>
<p>So, when I log this:</p>
<br><pre><code class="language-javascript">
arr.filter(val =&gt; val == false)
</pre></code><br>
<p>it seems to work, so now I need to think of a way of removing these values from the array. Maybe I’m thinking backwards actually. It’s probably much easier to use the filter to return all truthy values.</p>
<p>It’s kind of working, but there are several kinks. I wonder if it’s a quirk of javascript that my function is registering undefined and false as false, but none of the other falsy values. I think it’s a problem with my function in the filter. I will try and write an if statement that just asks if(val) do something, else do nothing. Can I use a conditional with filter….? Let’s find out.</p>
<p>I don’t think so. I don’t think that’s a thing that can be done. From where I stand at the base of the mountain I can’t see a way to do it. So let’s keep climbing and see what else we find.</p>
<p>Um, actually yes. Yes it’s a thing. It’s totally a thing and it’s totally working. My whole function looks super slim and it’s working! This is it:</p>
<br><br><pre><code class="language-javascript">
function bouncer(arr) {
 return arr.filter(val => val ? true:false);
}
</pre></code><br><br>
<p>That’s the whole thing! Definitely the sexiest function I have written so far.</p>
