          While creating factorial algorithm, biggest roadblock was in not
          recognising that the formula was trying to multiply by 0 so the result
          kept coming back as NaN. The solution was to take the number that was
          to be factorised, create an array from 1 to that number, and then
          create a <span class='code-bit-func'>for</span>  loop:
        </p>
        <br>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
                let sum = 0;
                for (let i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
                        sum = sum * arr[i];
                    }
        </code></pre>
        <br>
        <p>
          My first attempt to run this loop was unsuccessful and kept returning 0. 
          That's because I didn't acknowledge the fact that starting the loop at 0 
          means that the sum will never be larger than 0 because every time we are 
          multiplying by 0. So I fixed the problem by changing the default value of 
          <span class='code-bit-var'>sum</span> to 1, and the default value of 
          <span class='code-bit-var'>i</span> in the <span class='code-bit-func'>for</span> loop that created the 
          initial array to 1.

        <p>
          The first part of the problem was to convert the string into an array of
          words. For this I used the split() method, giving &quot; &quot; as the
          splitting parameter. I then had to find a way to get the lengths of
          each string in this array. I thought that the length property only
          worked on arrays, so spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to
          convert the strings in the array to separate characters in a sub-array
          which was super messy and confusing. It turns out you <em>can</em> use the
          length property to just get the length of a string.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second part of the challenge is to figure out a way to compare the
          numbers in the newly created strLenArr to find the largest one. At
          first I thought this would be simple, but am struggling to come up
          with a solution on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turns out it <em>was</em> simple! It's just a matter of creating an <span class='code-bit-func'>if</span>  
          statement in a for loop. The <span class='code-bit-func'>for</span> loop runs through each element in the array 
          and the <span class='code-bit-func'>if</span>  statement checks if that element is higher than the number stored 
          in the variable <span class='code-bit-var'>highest</span>. 
          <span class='code-bit-var'>highest</span> is set to 0 by default so the first 
          number encountered in the <span class='code-bit-func'>for</span>  loop becomes the new value for 
          <span class='code-bit-var'>highest</span>. Each time the for loop iterates, 
          the <span class='code-bit-func'>if</span>  statement checks the value of the current element in the array
          against <span class='code-bit-var'>highest</span>. If it's higher, it will
          become the new value for <span class='code-bit-var'>highest</span>.

                    const splitStr = str.split(" ");
                    let strLenArr = [];
                    for (let i=0; i&lt;splitStr.length; i++){
                      strLenArr.push(splitStr[i].length)

        Bearing some resemblance to the previous problem where the longest string had to 
        be found, this problem is somewhat more complex since the array is 2-dimensional, 
        which means that I will probably have to use a nested <span class='code-bit-func'>for</span> loop to access the sub-arrays.

        <br><br><pre><code class="language-javascript">
          function largestOfFour(arr) {
            let newArr=[];
            for(let i=0; i&lt;arr.length; i++){
              for(let j=0; j&lt;arr[i].length; j++){
                console.log(arr[i][j])
              }
            } 
            return arr;
          }
          
          largestOfFour([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]);
        </code></pre><br> 

        I created <span class='code-bit-var'>newArr</span>  to store the highest number in each sub-array. I created the nested for 
        loop, but am not sure what to do with it. currently it just returns every number in every 
        sub-array in a row. I need there to be a break between looping through sub-arrays so that 
        my if statement is not looking for the highest number across all sub-arrays. I will go and 
        look at some examples of nested <span class='code-bit-func'>for</span>  loops to see if anything looks useful. 
        <br><br>
        I guess I'm looking for a way to break out of the inner loop when the highest number in that 
        sub-array is found. So perhaps putting an <span class='code-bit-func'>if</span>  statement there will accomplish this.
        <br><br>
        I feel like I'm getting closer. I realised that to exit the inner loop there just needs to 
        be something returned from an <span class='code-bit-func'>if</span>  statement. I've added an <span class='code-bit-func'>else if</span> condition to try and stop 
        the loop from continuing to push to <span class='code-bit-var'>num</span> if it passes.... okay .... that's dumb. I don't think 
        that part makes sense actually.
        <br><br>
        The inner for loop is fine, I just need to somehow push <span class='code-bit-var'>num</span> to <span class='code-bit-var'>newArr</span>  when the inner (j) 
        loop finishes executing.
        <br><br>
        What if I add another <span class='code-bit-func'>if</span>  statement to the inner loop... No... an OR condition in the of 
        statement that says 'if the inner loop has reached the length of the array, push <span class='code-bit-var'>num</span> to 
        the new array...'<br><br>
        Not quite right but along the right lines...
        <br><br>
        Actually yes, two <span class='code-bit-func'>if</span>  statements in the inner loop. The first checks if the number in the 
        sub-array is larger than num, then updates <span class='code-bit-var'>num</span> with that number. The second if statement 
        checks if the loop has reached the end of the sub-array. But I can't think of a way to track 
        the progress of the loop unless I add a<span class='code-bit-var'>count</span> er to the first <span class='code-bit-func'>if</span>  statement: <span class='code-bit-var'>count++</span>. This 
        will iterate a variable in the outer loop that will reset each time the inner loop finishes 
        executing. So the second <span class='code-bit-func'>if</span>  statement will compare the number stored in <span class='code-bit-var'>count</span>  to the length 
        of the array. If they are the same, then push <span class='code-bit-var'>num</span> to <span class='code-bit-var'>newArr</span> .

        <br><br><pre><code class="language-javascript">
        function largestOfFour(arr) {
          let newArr = [];
          for(let i=0; i&lt;arr.length; i++){
            let num = 0;
            let count=0;
            for(let j=0; j&lt;arr[i].length; j++){
              count++
              if(arr[i][j] > num){
                num = arr[i][j];
              }
              if(count==arr[i].length){
                newArr.push(num);
              }console.log(newArr)
            }
          } 
          return newArr;
        }
        
        largestOfFour([[17, 23, 25, 12], [25, 7, 34, 48], [4, -10, 18, 21], [-72, -3, -17, -10]]);

        So close now! This returns the correct array for most inputs, but if the inputs are negative 
        numbers it fails because the <span class='code-bit-func'>if</span>  statement is comparing to 0. 
        <br><br>
        Ideally, instead of comparing the 
        element in the sub-array at [i][j] to a standalone variable outside the loop, I would compare 
        it to the last number that has just been passed so that the reference for size is not fixed at 
        0 to begin with. But this seems quite beyond me at this point in time and I think its time to 
        move on so I will just set <span class='code-bit-var'>num</span> to a very low negative number. That should take care of the 
        problem, but is a cop-out for sure. I hope to return to this problem one day better-equipped 
        to truly solve it.
