        A log of the thought processes I have been through and solutions I have come to in trying to solve javascript problems.

          While creating factorial algorithm, biggest roadblock was in not
          recognising that the formula was trying to multiply by 0 so the result
          kept coming back as NaN. The solution was to take the number that was
          to be factorised, create an array from 1 to that number, and then
          create a for loop:
        </p>
        <br>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
                let sum = 0;
                for (let i = 0; i &lt; arr.length; i++) {
                        sum = sum * arr[i];
                    }
        </code></pre>
        <br>
        <p>
          My first attempt to run this loop was unsuccessful and kept returning 0. 
          That's because I didn't acknowledge the fact that starting the loop at 0 
          means that the sum will never be larger than 0 because every time we are 
          multiplying by 0. So I fixed the problem by changing the default value of 
          <span class='code-bit-var'>sum</span> to 1, and the default value of 
          <span class='code-bit-var'>i</span> in the for loop that created the 
          initial array to 1.

        <p>
          The first part of the problem was to convert the string into an array of
          words. For this I used the split() method, giving &quot; &quot; as the
          splitting parameter. I then had to find a way to get the lengths of
          each string in this array. I thought that the length property only
          worked on arrays, so spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to
          convert the strings in the array to separate characters in a sub-array
          which was super messy and confusing. It turns out you <em>can</em> use the
          length property to just get the length of a string.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second part of the challenge is to figure out a way to compare the
          numbers in the newly created strLenArr to find the largest one. At
          first I thought this would be simple, but am struggling to come up
          with a solution on my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turns out it <em>was</em> simple! It's just a matter of creating an if 
          statement in a for loop. The for loop runs through each element in the array 
          and the if statement checks if that element is higher than the number stored 
          in the variable <span class='code-bit-var'>highest</span>. 
          <span class='code-bit-var'>highest</span> is set to 0 by default so the first 
          number encountered in the for loop becomes the new value for 
          <span class='code-bit-var'>highest</span>. Each time the for loop iterates, 
          the if statement checks the value of the current element in the array
          against <span class='code-bit-var'>highest</span>. If it's higher, it will
          become the new value for <span class='code-bit-var'>highest</span>.
        </p><br>
        <pre><code class="language-javascript">
                function findLongestWordLength(str) {
                    const splitStr = str.split(" ");
                    let strLenArr = [];
                    for (let i=0; i&lt;splitStr.length; i++){
                      strLenArr.push(splitStr[i].length)
                    }
                  
                    let highest = 0;
                  
                    for (let j=0; j&lt;strLenArr.length; j++){
                      if(strLenArr[j]>highest){
                        highest=strLenArr[j];
                        }
                      }
                  
                    console.log(highest)
                    return str.length;
                  }
